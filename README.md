# Silicone Crisis Project


In this project there are basically 3 "types" of objects.  There are mines, which produce raw materials, factories which take raw materials and convert them using recipes, and there are materials (raw or otherwise) which are either made or consumed by factories to make new products which are also materials. 
Each game starts with 2 mines and 2 factories, and no other resources.  

command line to run project: 
python3 silicon_crisis.py
